# Honor Code

As a member of the Olin College community, I will strive to embody the spirit of honor and integrity as defined by the five core personal values and will take action to address any breach of that spirit.

**Integrity:** I will represent myself accurately and completely in my work, my words, and my actions in academic and
in non-academic affairs.

**Respect for Others:** Each member of the college community will be considerate of fellow community members and honor each individual's inherent dignity and worth.

**Passion for the Welfare of the College:** Each member of the college community will express a personal commitment to the welfare of the community through a spirit of cooperation, concern for others, and responsibility for the reputation of Olin College.

**Patience and Understanding:** Each member of the college community will strive to foster harmonious relationships through empathy and mindfulness of others.

**Openness to Change:** Each member of the college community will be receptive to change and will strive for innovation and improvement within the community.

**Do Something:** When aware of a potential violation of the Honor Code or related policies, a member of the college community must take action in a timely manner to address the situation. While all violations are treated with utmost concern, academic and non-academic cases differ in nature and therefore often call for different courses of action. Suspected violations of integrity in academic work must be reported to the professor of the course or directly to the Honor Board. Other suspected violations must either be addressed informally to the satisfaction of all parties involved or reported to the Honor Board.
